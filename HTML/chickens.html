Chicken
The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may be called a cockerel; a male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BCE).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets.
