      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red
      junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl. Rooster or cock is a term for
      an adult male bird. A younger male may be called a cockerel; a male that
      has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen.
      Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
      were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries
      BCE).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
      (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets.

      Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with
      a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[3] up from more than 19
      billion in 2011.[4] There are more chickens in the world than any other
      bird.[4] There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth,
      folklore and religion, and in language and literature.
